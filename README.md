# An Accessible AI-Powered Web Application for Proactive Skin Health Monitoring

Skin conditions such as acne, eczema, and rosacea are common among teenagers, causing both physical discomfort and emotional distress that can negatively affect academic performance and overall well-being. Proactive skin health management is vital, particularly with severe conditions like melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer that can be fatal if not detected early. While biopsies and imaging tests are effective, they are invasive, costly, and often inaccessible to many.

This project presents an AI-powered web application that leverages machine learning (ML) to address these skin health challenges. The app offers a user-friendly platform for early detection of various skin issues, including skin cancer, by analyzing images captured with everyday devices like smartphones. Users can easily upload or take photos of their skin, receive real-time assessments, and access educational resources aimed at promoting skin health awareness. By providing a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to traditional diagnostic methods, the app seeks to lower barriers to early detection, empowering individuals to proactively manage their skin health and improve outcomes for a wide range of skin conditions.
